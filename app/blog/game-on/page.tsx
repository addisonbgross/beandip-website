          Hey there! Welcome to beandip games ðŸ™‚. Weâ€™re an independent game
          studio located in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. Weâ€™re working on
          our first game, currently untitled. Our project has been stewing for a
          few years, and weâ€™ve recently taken a leap to work on it full time.
          Our goal with this blog is to share project updates, as well as our
          challenges and triumphs, during the development process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our game is a small-scale, real-time strategy adventure. We aim to
          create a unique gaming experience, deriving inspiration from a variety
          of game types including colony simulators and old school real-time
          strategy.
